# prediction-of-ainbnormality-in-BloodPressure
Overall, this project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict abnormal blood pressure levels based on demographic and health-related features. The notebook contains detailed explanations, code, and visualizations for each step in the project.
Data Collection: The dataset used in this project is collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.

Data Preprocessing: The raw dataset is cleaned, processed, and transformed into a structured format suitable for machine learning. This includes data cleaning, handling missing values, feature selection, and feature engineering.

Data Visualization: The data is visualized using various graphical techniques to gain insights into the data distribution, correlation between features, and identify patterns in the data.

Model Development: Several machine learning models are developed and evaluated using the preprocessed data. The models include logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), random forest, and XGBoost.

Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best performing model is selected for further analysis.

Model Interpretation: The selected model is analyzed to interpret the feature importance and the contribution of each feature in predicting abnormal blood pressure levels.
